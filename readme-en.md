# What You Seek is Seeking You

This project is built upon the excellent open-source project [Notea](https://github.com/notea-org/notea), and fully complies with its MIT license. It introduces a series of improvements and refinements based on the original architecture, making it more suitable for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), especially in combination with [Neon](https://neon.tech)'s PostgreSQL database service.

## üåü Project Highlights

- ‚úçÔ∏è Switched the editor to [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev) for a true WYSIWYG editing experience.

- üß† Retained support for / markdown command shortcuts and right-click floating markdown syntax menu.

- üíæ Switched to manual saving mode.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Refactored the upload and loading logic to align with the new editor and save strategy, reducing unnecessary function calls and improving performance.

- üß± Maintained the original borderless note page layout.

- üîê Preserved the original authentication and encryption mechanism.

- üîÅ Kept the original note management and sharing logic.

- üñºÔ∏è Removed local image upload support. All images are rendered using markdown image links, resulting in a more Typora-like experience.

- üì¶ For image upload and hosting, you can refer to my original project [Mazine](https://github.com/waycaan/mazine).

## üöÄ Deployment (Recommended: Vercel + Neon)

> For best performance, please use the Neon database in Washington, D.C., USA (East). Since most users deploy on Vercel's free plan (with servers based in the U.S.), using this region ensures the lowest latency.

Although the original project has been discontinued, I've always wanted to bring it back ‚Äî simply because it's elegant.

However, I believe using S3 as the core storage solution was a fundamental design flaw. S3 isn't well-suited for frequent modifications or file renaming, and the implementation varies across different object storage providers. Because of this, I chose not to submit a PR to the original repo, but instead rewrote and restructured the project independently.

All redesign concepts in this project are entirely my own. That said, I did use AI tools to assist with development where the technical complexity exceeded my current personal capabilities.

I originally wanted to call this project newnotea, but it didn‚Äôt feel elegant enough. So I named it Motea ‚Äî keeping all the original icons untouched, as a tribute to the original project, and to my own youth.
